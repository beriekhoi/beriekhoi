lmfaoooooo I can add a README.md to my profile


If you wanna do this, you have to create a public repository and start it with a README.md file which is this one and the repository has to be called as your github username. Then you'll see a message that says something like "beriekhoi/beriekhoi is a secret! You can add a README.md file to your profile to say something about you!"
